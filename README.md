# HER RIDE

## About: #
HER RIDE began with a simple, powerful question:

“What would transportation look like if women designed it for themselves?”

This project explores that answer.

Across India, countless women navigate their days with a quiet undercurrent of fear—avoiding late travel, sharing live locations, calling family during rides and planning their lives around safety. Through interviews and real stories this project uncovers those everyday struggles and the emotional weight behind them.

From these voices, HER RIDE took shape:

A ride-hailing solution built for women by women—where every ride is driven by a verified female driver, every journey has real-time support and every interaction is grounded in trust. The project brings these insights to life through detailed personas, empathy maps and value propositions that illuminate not just what women need but why they need it.

The journey continues with a clearly defined MVP focused on safety and reliability, followed by a thoughtful roadmap to grow Her Ride from a single-city pilot into a nationwide ecosystem. It also draws a sharp contrast with traditional ride-hailing platforms, showing how Her Ride differentiates itself through community, empowerment and purpose—not just transportation.

In essence, this project is more than a product concept.
It’s a narrative of women reclaiming mobility, independence and peace of mind.

HER RIDE isn’t just a service—it’s a movement.
And this repository captures how that movement begins.
